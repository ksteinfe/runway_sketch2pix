# Sketch2Pix
AI Augmented Architectural Sketching

Hosted in this repository is an interactive application for supporting architectural sketching augmented by Pix2Pix models. We envision that these Pix2Pix models are produced by novice users, trained on their own data, and for their own use in sketching architectural forms. Following a number of precedent projects, we present workflows that allow for creative authors to train a Pix2Pix model on the transformation from a "source" image depicting a sketch, consisting primarily of hand-drawn lines, to a "target" image depicting a photograph of an architectural object (such as a scaled architectural model) that includes desired features such as color, texture, material, and shade/shadow.
